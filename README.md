This probably doesn't work anymore because MemeLoad doesn't exist at the time of me writing this and I >forgot to commit the update that allows for downloading many at once.

# MemeMirrorLoad
A complete mirror of https://memeload.us running on https://memeload.itserikmc.com

## Download
https://github.com/ItsErikSquared/MemeMirrorLoad/releases

## Downloading Memes
You need to use 'MemeDownLoad' to actually load the memes. This will require ALOT of space, and It will take a LONG time.
```
node mdl
```

## Hosting Memes
To host the memes, you can use 'MemeMirrorHost' which acts as a complete clone of https://memeload.us, including endpoints.
This may be running while memes are downloading, and it will update as more memes download via MemeDownLoad (every 30 seconds).
```
node mml
```
