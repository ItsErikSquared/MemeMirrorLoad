## Downloading Memes
You need to use 'MemeDownLoad' to actually load the memes. This will require ALOT of space, and It will take a LONG time.
```
node mdl
```

## Hosting Memes
To host the memes, you can use 'MemeMirrorHost' which acts as a complete clone of https://memeload.us, including endpoints.
This may be running while memes are downloading, and it will update as more memes download via MemeDownLoad (every 30 seconds).
```
node mml
```
